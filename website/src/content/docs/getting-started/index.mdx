Start by [installing](/installation/crates-io) `binsider`:

```bash
cargo install binsider
```

Also, check the other installation methods on the left sidebar.

Now you are ready to dive into the binaries! âœ¨ Simply run:

```bash
binsider <binary>
```

You can also run `binsider` without any arguments to analyze the `binsider` binary itself!

`binsider` helps you get inside of the ELF binaries.

:::note[What the heck is ELF?]

[ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) (Executable and Linkable Format) is the standard executable format for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. They are used for executables, shared libraries, and core dumps.

:::

It provides a Terminal User Interface ([TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)) which is designed to perform:

- [General analysis](/usage/general-analysis) about a file including listing the shared libraries.
- [Static analysis](/usage/static-analysis) for exploring the ELF layout.
- [Dynamic analysis](/usage/dynamic-analysis) for debugging and tracing.
- [String extraction](/usage/strings) for finding interesting strings.
- [Hexdump](/usage/hexdump) for viewing the binary content.

For detailed documentation on these features, please refer to the links provided above.


Happy hacking! ðŸ’£
